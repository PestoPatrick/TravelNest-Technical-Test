The exercise:

Please write some code that retrieves the details of the latest SpaceX launch, and displays:

The name, date, and details of the launch

The name, type and home port of each ship assigned to the launch

This can be implemented in any language you prefer, and can be displayed in whichever context you are most familiar with, be it a React SPA or a command line application. Please put your project into a code repository and share it with us.
