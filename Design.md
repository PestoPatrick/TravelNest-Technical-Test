Basic steps of what my program will go through:

Retrieve the latest launch information

parse the data and store the name, 
date and details of the launch in an object and display the information
and extract the ship ids into an array

use this array to send get requests to the server to retrieve information on each ship

display the name, type and home port of each ship


I will maybe make the webpage look like below, if the rest doesn't take too long!

            Launch Details
            <launch details here>

        <columns of objects for each ship>


        Ship Name
        Type
        HomePort

        Ship Name
        Type
        HomePort
        
        etc
